Notes for rubygems{1.8|1.9|1.9.1} in Debian
=====================================

Since some patches are applied to fit Debian FHS, Debian's RubyGems behaves
a bit differently than the original.

* Directory where gems are to be installed

/var/lib/gems is default in Debian instead of /usr/lib/gems. You can
override it by defining GEM_HOME environment variable. 

* Executables provided by gems

Gems which Debian's RubyGems will install are stored at /var/lib/gems instead
of /usr/lib/ruby/gems. Executables of the gems will be put at
/var/lib/gems/{1.8|1.9|1.9.1}/bin. In order to use them you manually have to
add the directory in your PATH environment variable or make symbolic links at
/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
