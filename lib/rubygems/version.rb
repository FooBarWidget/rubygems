  # The Version class processes string versions into comparable
  # values. A version string should normally be a series of numbers
  # separated by periods. Each part (digits separated by periods) is
  # considered its own number, and these are used for sorting. So for
  # instance, 3.10 sorts higher than 3.2 because ten is greater than
  # two.
  #
  # If any part contains letters (currently only a-z are supported) then
  # that version is considered prerelease. Versions with a prerelease
  # part in the Nth part sort less than versions with N-1 parts. Prerelease
  # parts are sorted alphabetically using the normal Ruby string sorting
  # rules.
  #
  # Prereleases sort between real releases (newest to oldest):
  #
  # 1. 1.0
  # 2. 1.0.b
  # 3. 1.0.a
  # 4. 0.9

  # == Preventing Version Catastrophe:

  # From: http://blog.zenspider.com/2008/10/rubygems-howto-preventing-cata.html
  #
  # Let's say you're depending on the fnord gem version 2.y.z. If you
  # specify your dependency as ">= 2.0.0" then, you're good, right? What
  # happens if fnord 3.0 comes out and it isn't backwards compatible
  # with 2.y.z? Your stuff will break as a result of using ">=". The
  # better route is to specify your dependency with a "spermy" version
  # specifier. They're a tad confusing, so here is how the dependency
  # specifiers work:
  #
  #   Specification From  ... To (exclusive)
  #   ">= 3.0"      3.0   ... &infin;
  #   "~> 3.0"      3.0   ... 4.0
  #   "~> 3.0.0"    3.0.0 ... 3.1
  #   "~> 3.5"      3.5   ... 4.0
  #   "~> 3.5.0"    3.5.0 ... 3.6
